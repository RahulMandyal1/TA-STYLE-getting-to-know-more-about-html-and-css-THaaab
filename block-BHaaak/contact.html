            When you think of great website design, you probably think about a website’s homepage, or their blog, or their product pages.

            But what about a website’s ‘Contact Us’ page?
            
            Far too many website designers put contact pages near the bottom of their priority list in terms of copywriting and design. Think about how many contact pages you’ve stumbled upon that look like they were built in the 1990s, even if the rest of the website is beautiful and updated.
            
            That, my friends, is a huge mistake. Your ‘Contact Us’ page is one of the top four most important pages on your website. For most companies, it’s typically one of the most-visited site pages.
